# Building a USB HID Dance Pad with the Raspberry Pi Pico

This post documents the design and implementation of a USB HID
dance pad using a Raspberry Pi Pico and force-sensitive resistors.
The focus is on reliable input handling under hardware constraints.

---

## System Overview

The system consists of a Raspberry Pi Pico configured as a USB
keyboard device, with multiple force-sensitive resistors connected
to GPIO pins.

Key constraints:
- Real-time input responsiveness
- Signal noise from analog sensors
- USB HID timing requirements

---

## GPIO Input Handling

Each sensor is sampled and debounced in software to ensure
consistent activation without false triggers.

The debouncing logic was implemented to balance responsiveness
with stability.

---

## USB HID Emulation

The Pico presents itself as a standard USB keyboard, allowing
the device to work without custom drivers.

---

## Lessons Learned

This project reinforced the importance of understanding both
hardware behavior and software timing when designing embedded
input systems.
